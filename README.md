# ClimateChange
Trying to create a model to replicate the results of the IPCC scenario analysis to predict the global average temperature in 2050 and 2100.
For example:
Scenario 1: Extrapolation based on the current greenhouse gas emissions
Scenario 2: Extrapolation based on the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions
